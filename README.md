## Problem: 
The whiskey market is expansive with thousands of options to choose from. This is assuming you can even get your hands on some of them to choose from. Whiskeys on the market have a wide array of prices ranging anywhere from $10 to $10,000. In many states, this pricing is not set, meaning that they can be sold for inflated prices (or less than suggested retail price (SRP) if you are very lucky). 

Beyond MSRP, many retailers are known for marking up bottles based on their rarity or their allocation. Beyond retail stores, there are secondary bourbon markets that tend to be able to offer bottles that would be difficult to find in a retail store, these however charge a premium for the bottles. 

Does high price correlate with high ratings?
What %ABV is optimal for the achieving the highest rating?
What flavor characteristics are observed in some of the highest rated bourbons?
Can bourbon be a new investment opportunity? What bottles pull the greatest ROI?
